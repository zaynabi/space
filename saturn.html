<h1 id="str">Saturn</h1>
<p>Adorned with a dazzling, complex system of icy rings, Saturn is unique in our solar system. The other giant planets have rings, but none are as spectacular as Saturn's. Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.</p>  
<p>GAS GIANT : Saturn is a gas-giant planet and therefore does not have a solid surface like Earth’s. But it might have a solid core somewhere in there.</p>
<p>LIFELESS BEHEMOTH : Saturn cannot support life as we know it, but some of Saturn's moons have conditions that might support life.</p>
