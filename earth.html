<p>Earth—our home planet—is the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things. It's also the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.
    Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.</p>
<p>Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." </p>
<p>HOME, SWEET HOME : Earth is the perfect place for life as we know it.</p>
<p>PROTECTIVE SHIELD : Our atmosphere protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface.</p>
