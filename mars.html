    <h1 id="br">Mars</h1>
    <p>Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. There is strong evidence Mars was – billions of years ago – wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere.  Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.</p>
<p>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.</p>
<p>TOUGH PLACE FOR LIFE : At this time, Mars' surface cannot support life as we know it. Current missions are determining Mars' past and future potential for life.</p>
