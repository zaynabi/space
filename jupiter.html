<h1 id="bl">Jupiter</h1>
<p>Jupiter is more than twice as massive than the other planets of our solar system combined. The giant planet's Great Red Spot is a centuries-old storm bigger than Earth. Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.</p>
  <p>Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.</p>    
<p>INGREDIENTS FOR LIFE? : Jupiter cannot support life as we know it. But some of Jupiter's moons have oceans beneath their crusts that might support life.</p>
