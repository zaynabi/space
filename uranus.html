<h1 id="bl2">Uranus</h1>
<p>Uranus—seventh planet from the Sun—rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side.
    </p>
<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.</p>
<p>LIFELESS : Uranus cannot support life as we know it.</p>
<p>ONE COOL FACT : Like Venus, Uranus rotates east to west. But Uranus is unique in that it rotates on its side.</p>
